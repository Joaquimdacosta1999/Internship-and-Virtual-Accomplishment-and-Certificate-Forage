# Datacom Software Development Job Simulation

## Why I Completed This Simulation

I chose to complete the Datacom Software Development Job Simulation through the Forage platform to get a hands-on, risk-free look at what it's like to work on a software development team at Datacom. This program allowed me to practice and build my skills in a real-world context, which will help me confidently answer interview questions and demonstrate my fit for a role.

## What I Learned and Practiced

This simulation provided an opportunity to learn and practice several key skills, including:

**Written Communication:** Clearly articulating my findings and solutions.

**Software Evaluation:** Reviewing an application and planning for future improvements.

**Critical Thinking:** Analyzing problems and devising effective solutions.

**Software Development:** Applying practical development skills to a project.

**Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the underlying issues behind software bugs.

**Development Tools:** Using tools to diagnose and fix problems in code.

## My Journey Through the Tasks

### Task 1: Software Review

In this task, I took on the role of an apprentice on the software development team. My goal was to improve a web application designed to find and filter cinemas in Australia and New Zealand.

**What I did:** I reviewed customer feedback to understand the user experience and usability of the application. I then created a summarized list of bugs and new features to help the development team plan their next steps.

### Task 2: Identifying Root Causes and Fixing Bugs

After summarizing the feedback, I dived into the application's code to find and fix a specific bug.

**What I did:** I accessed the codebase and used developer tools to identify the root cause of a bug. I then implemented a fix and updated the code to improve the application's functionality.
