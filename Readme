# Forage Job Simulations Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio to document and showcase the job simulations I have completed on the Forage platform. Each simulation is designed to provide practical, on-the-job experience and help me develop key skills in a professional environment.

## Why This Portfolio?

I created this repository to:

**Document My Learning Journey**: Keep a detailed record of the skills and tasks I completed for each simulation.

**Showcase My Abilities:** Provide a clear, organized portfolio for potential employers to view my practical experience.

**Reflect and Improve:** Use the README.md files within each folder to summarize my key takeaways, challenges, and solutions for each project.

**Completed Job Simulations**
This section will be updated as I complete more simulations. Each link will take you to a dedicated folder containing the certificate and a detailed README.md for that specific project.
